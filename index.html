    const topics = {
      "Closures": { question: "What is a closure?", answer: "A closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function." },
      "Promises": { question: "What is a Promise?", answer: "A Promise represents a value that may be available now, later, or never." },
      "Hoisting": { question: "What is hoisting?", answer: "Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of a scope." },
      "Event Loop": { question: "What is the event loop?", answer: "It is a mechanism that handles asynchronous code in JavaScript." },
      "Async/Await": { question: "How do async/await work?", answer: "`async` makes a function return a promise. `await` makes JavaScript wait until the promise resolves." },
      "Prototype": { question: "What is prototype in JS?", answer: "It's an object from which other objects inherit properties." },
      "Call, Apply, Bind": { question: "Difference between call, apply and bind?", answer: "`call` and `apply` call a function immediately, `bind` returns a new function." },
      "Arrow Functions": { question: "What is an arrow function?", answer: "A concise syntax for writing functions. Does not bind its own `this`." },
      "IIFE": { question: "What is an IIFE?", answer: "Immediately Invoked Function Expression: runs as soon as it’s defined." },
      "SetTimeout": { question: "How does setTimeout work?", answer: "It delays function execution by specified milliseconds." },
      "SetInterval": { question: "What is setInterval?", answer: "Calls a function repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call." },
      "Map": { question: "What is Map?", answer: "A collection of keyed data items, like an Object, but keys can be any type." },
      "Set": { question: "What is Set?", answer: "A collection of unique values." },
      "WeakMap": { question: "What is WeakMap?", answer: "A Map where keys are weakly held and must be objects." },
      "WeakSet": { question: "What is WeakSet?", answer: "A Set of objects, held weakly." },
      "Destructuring": { question: "What is destructuring?", answer: "A way to extract values from arrays or objects into variables." },
      "Rest Parameters": { question: "What are rest parameters?", answer: "Allows representing an indefinite number of arguments as an array." },
      "Spread Operator": { question: "What is the spread operator?", answer: "Expands an array or object into individual elements." },
      "Template Literals": { question: "What are template literals?", answer: "String literals allowing embedded expressions using backticks (`)." },
      "This Keyword": { question: "What is `this` in JS?", answer: "`this` refers to the object it belongs to, varies by context." },
      "Type Coercion": { question: "What is type coercion?", answer: "Automatic or implicit conversion of values from one type to another." },
      "NaN": { question: "What is NaN?", answer: "Stands for 'Not a Number', a value resulting from invalid number operations." },
      "isNaN vs Number.isNaN": { question: "Difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?", answer: "`isNaN` coerces before checking, `Number.isNaN` checks strictly." },
      "== vs ===": { question: "== vs ===?", answer: "`==` checks value, `===` checks value and type (strict equality)." },
      "null vs undefined": { question: "null vs undefined?", answer: "`null` is assigned, `undefined` is absence of assignment." },
      "Event Bubbling": { question: "What is event bubbling?", answer: "Events propagate from child to parent unless stopped." },
      "Event Capturing": { question: "What is event capturing?", answer: "Events propagate from parent to child." },
      "Debounce": { question: "What is debouncing?", answer: "Limits how often a function is called after repeated events." },
      "Throttle": { question: "What is throttling?", answer: "Ensures a function is called at most once per time interval." },
      "LocalStorage": { question: "What is localStorage?", answer: "Web storage that persists even after browser is closed." },
      "SessionStorage": { question: "What is sessionStorage?", answer: "Cleared when the page session ends." },
      "Cookies": { question: "What are cookies?", answer: "Small data stored on the client used for session tracking." },
      "AJAX": { question: "What is AJAX?", answer: "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, used for server communication." },
      "Fetch API": { question: "What is Fetch API?", answer: "Modern interface for making HTTP requests." },
      "CORS": { question: "What is CORS?", answer: "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, controls resource access across origins." },
      "JSON": { question: "What is JSON?", answer: "JavaScript Object Notation, used for data interchange." },
      "Callback": { question: "What is a callback?", answer: "A function passed into another function as an argument." },
      "Promise States": { question: "What are the states of a promise?", answer: "Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected." },
      "Microtasks vs Macrotasks": { question: "What’s the difference?", answer: "Microtasks (like Promise callbacks) run before macrotasks (setTimeout, etc)." },
      "Memory Leak": { question: "What is a memory leak?", answer: "Memory that is no longer used but not released." },
      "Garbage Collection": { question: "What is garbage collection?", answer: "Automatic memory management to clean unused objects." },
      "Pure Function": { question: "What is a pure function?", answer: "Returns same output for same input, with no side effects." },
      "Immutable": { question: "What is immutability?", answer: "Data that cannot be changed once created." },
      "Functional Programming": { question: "What is functional programming?", answer: "A programming paradigm emphasizing pure functions and immutability." },
      "DOM": { question: "What is the DOM?", answer: "Document Object Model - a tree structure representing the webpage." },
      "BOM": { question: "What is BOM?", answer: "Browser Object Model - browser-specific features like window, screen, navigator." },
      "Strict Mode": { question: "What is strict mode?", answer: "`'use strict'` enables stricter parsing and error handling." },
      "typeof": { question: "What is typeof?", answer: "Operator to get the data type of a variable." },
      "instanceof": { question: "What is instanceof?", answer: "Tests whether an object is an instance of a constructor." },
      "Map vs Object": { question: "Map vs Object?", answer: "Maps can have any type of keys, maintain insertion order." },
      "Event Delegation": { question: "What is event delegation?", answer: "Using one event listener for multiple child elements." },
      "Polyfill": { question: "What is a polyfill?", answer: "Code that adds missing functionality to older browsers." },
      "Transpiling": { question: "What is transpiling?", answer: "Converting modern JS to older JS for compatibility." },
